## Simple Exercises

Defining a list:
```
monty_films = ["And Now For Something Completly Different",
				"Monty Python and the Holy Grail",
				"Monty Python's Life of Brain",
				"Monty Python live at the Hollywood Bowl",
				"Monty Python's the meaning of life"]
```  

Length:
```
>>> len(monty_films)
5
``` 

Uppercase:
```
>>> monty_films[0].upper()
'AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETLY DIFFERENT'
```
Count:
```
>>> monty_films[1].count("Monty")
1
```
Lowercase:
```
>>> monty_films[0].lower()
'and now for something completly different'
```
Index:
```
>>> monty_films[2].index("Monty")
0
```
Reverse:
```
>>> print monty_films.reverse()

["Monty Python's the meaning of life", 
'Monty Python live at the Hollywood Bowl', 
"Monty Python's Life of Brain", 
'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', 
'And Now For Something Completly Different']
```
Split:
```
>>> monty_films[0].split()
['Monty', "Python's", 'the', 'meaning', 'of', 'life']
```
Startswith:
```
>>> [i for i in range(len(monty_films)) if monty_films[i].startswith('M')]
 [0, 1, 2, 3] / the array is in reversed order now.
```
Range examples:
```
# for a string it grabs those indeces up to but not including 
>>> monty_films[0][2:10]
'd Now Fo'
```
```
# for a list - same deal, it will grab those indeces
>>> monty_films[1:3]
['Monty Python and the Holy Grail', "Monty Python's Life of Brain"]
```
```
# if the index is higher than the list, the remaining indices are returned as empty, so no error is thrown
>>> monty_films[:10]
['And Now For Something Completly Different', 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', "Monty Python's Life of Brain", 'Monty Python live at the Hollywood Bowl', "Monty Python's the meaning of life"]
```

If you noticed from before, the .reverse() changes the orignal list permanently. To avoid that, we can make a copy of it using the range like so:
```
copy_array = Monty_films[:]
```

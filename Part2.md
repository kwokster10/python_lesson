## Objects:

Everything in Python is object-oriented just like in Ruby. You can define custom classes like so. 

```
class Python:
    age = 12
    color = "blue"
    length = "6 ft"
    name = ""
    
    def speak(self):
        talk = "%s hisssssed!" % self.name
        return (talk)

slytherin = Python()
print (slytherin.age)
slytherin.color = "yellow"
print (slytherin.color)
slytherin.name = "Snape"
print (slytherin.speak())
```

## Let's look at how functions are defined
```
def introduction():
    print "Hello everybody!"

introduction()
```
   A few important things to note:
   	1. The colon
   	2. The 4 spaces indentation
   	3. The parentheses: needed to declare and call the function
   	4. No termination but you do need to hit return in 'python' from the terminal to end the block 
   	5. If you are using repl.it, you will need parens around the print string


## Interesting things to note about functions: scope
```
 number = 3.14159
    def scope():
        number = 5
        print number
    scope()
    print number
```
    1. Inside the function, it would read the local variable and outside it would read the global. Since Python does not compile everything on load, it doesn't hit the number = 5 until the scope function is called.
    2. Similarly, if we had number = number + 5 in the function, we would get an error b/c it's trying to find a local variable number. You would need to make a new variable like number2 = number before you can add a value to number to itself.
    3. Using _ and //

## An fascinating function 

- if you are in the python interpreter, it will look like this with ... to remind you are in a block and >>> when you are not. 

```
def operate(num1, num2, num3, **operation):
...     if operation.get("addition") == "add":
...         print "The sum is: %d" % (num1 + num2 + num3)
...     if operation.get("subraction") == "subtract":
...         print "The difference is: %d" % (num1 - num2 - num3)
...     if operation.get("multiplication") == "multiply":
...         print "The * is: %d" % (num1 * num2 * num3)
...     if operation.get("division") == "divide":
...         print "The / is: %d" % (num1 / (num2 + num3))
...     if operation.get("exponent") == "power":
...         print "The ** is: %d" % ((num1 + num2) ** num3)
... 
>>> print operate(1, 2, 3, addition = "add", subraction = "subtract", multiplication = "multiply", division = "divide", exponent = "power")
```
   1. Obviously if you used 0 in num2 and num3 here, it would break at some of the operators but you get the idea. You can pass in more params too if you'd like.
   2. There is also a function with just one * that takes a variable number of arguments

## Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are a powerful language for matching text patterns. 
The Python "re" module provides regular expression support.

General format of a regex search in Python:

```
import re
match = re.search(pat, str)
```

where pat is the regex pattern, str is the string being searched, and match holds the contents of the successful match (if there is one), or None if there is no match.

Example:

```
import re
str = 'an example word:cat!!'
match = re.search(r'word:\w\w\w', str)
  if match:                      
    print 'found', match.group() ## 'found word:cat'
  else:
    print 'did not find'
```

the \w indicates a "word" character: a letter or number or underscore

the 'r' indicates a python "raw" string - not interpolated at all

Some other character classes:
-  \d  a digit
-  \s  a whitespace character
-  \S  a non-whitespace character
-   .  any character
-  \b  a word-boundary

There is a lot more logic to explore with respect to regular expressions.  If you'd like a challenge, you can try the Regex Crossword:  http://regexcrossword.com/

Julie has an example...

Mini Exercise: 
** Can't be done in repl.it
- touch a file called mini_ex.py 
- first line 'import sys' - like require for Ruby / JS
- Create a command line app that will take a string and return it printed in pig latin if the word starts with the letter 'p'. If the word is "Crawford", print "Hey Hey Hey". Otherwise print it in reverse one letter at a time in all caps. Hint, Python's equivalent of process.argv[2] is sys.argv[1].

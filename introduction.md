# Introduction to Python

![Newt](http://mindfunda.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/f297_airspeedvelocity.jpg)

## What it is?
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language, which emphasizes code readability. 
Its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be possible in other languages.  It is roughly analogous to Ruby, in its level of complexity, readability, and general usefulness.  There is an extensive discussion of the similarities and differences between Python and Ruby here:  http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonVsRuby

## What it's used for?
As a general-use language, Python can be used for a wide variety of tasks, but it is typically used on the server-side of web applications, or for scripting style tasks, such as testing / building / deployment / monitoring frameworks.

## Why do companies and other programmers choose it?
Developers typically choose to use Python because of its relatively easy readability (compare Java, or Perl), and because it is freely and widely available.

## Why you should learn it?
A 10-second search of "Python, New York, NY" on http://careers.stackoverflow.com yields 125 listings.  Also, Python is relatively straighforward to pick up, for people with programming experience, so, you may as well add another tool to your toolbelt.

Pick up a new language...

Next up, checking to see if you have it...
which python
python -V
python -version

V2 is the established version, widely used.
There is a V3, but the syntax is slightly different...

to install, try brew install python
 or to follow along, try repl.it

 Up next, Dipshikha is going to show us some basic Python syntax, with a few examples.

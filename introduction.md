# Introduction to Python

## What it is?
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language, which emphasizes code readability. 
Its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be possible in other languages.  It is roughly analogous to Ruby, in its level of complexity, readability, and general usefulness.  There is an extensive discussion of the similarities and differences between Python and Ruby here:  http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonVsRuby

## What it's used for?
As a general-use language, Python can be used for a wide variety of tasks, but it is typically used on the server-side of web applications, or for scripting style tasks, such as testing / building / deployment / monitoring frameworks.

## Why do companies and other programmers choose it?
Developers typically choose to use Python because of its relatively easy readability (compare Java, or Perl), and because it is freely and widely available.

## Why you should learn it?
